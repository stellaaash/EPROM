# Features
This module adds more features to the [[eCommerce]] online shop by allowing customers to rent products from the [[Rental]] module.
This is possible via a nifty calendar view on the product page before adding the rental to your cart.
This is the base for the [[eCommerce Rental with Planning]] and [[eCommerce Rental with Stock Management]] modules.
