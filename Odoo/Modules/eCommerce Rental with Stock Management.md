# Features
Stock management for renting assets using [[eCommerce Rental]].
It prevents over bookings by only allowing someone to book an asset if there is at least one available, and prevents anyone from renting a machine who doesn't have any stock available.
It darkens the dates on the calendar selector when an asset isn't available for renting.
It can also allow you to show you the available stock on the website.
