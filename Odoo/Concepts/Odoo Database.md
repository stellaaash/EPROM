An Odoo Database is a [[PostgreSQL]] database that stores all information necessary for using Odoo.
All records, [[Model]]s, [[View]]s, everything is contained within.
End users usually interact with the database using the front-end, where all actual usage of Odoo occurs.
# Duplicates
On Odoo Online, you can easily duplicate a database.
**This prevents all egress from the database; no actual emails, messages, or payments can be issued on the duplicated database**.
These databases expire *after 15 days*.
