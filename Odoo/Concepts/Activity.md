Activities are **follow-up tasks tied to a [[Record]] in an [[Odoo Database]]**.
They are usually represented by icons, which depend on the activity type.
# Activity Types
These are the default activities available in any [[Odoo Database]]:
-  (clock) icon: the default activities icon.
-  (phone) icon: a phone call is scheduled.

-  (users) icon: a meeting is scheduled.

**Of course, you can customize and create your own activities depending on your needs**.
