Burp Suite is a **framework designed for penetration-testing of web applications, mobile applications and their APIs**.
It captures HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a browser and the web server, and allows you to redirect them freely.
There exists both a free Community Edition and a Professional Edition, as well as even an Enterprise Edition for continuous surveillance of vulnerabilities.
# Features
## Proxy
**Enables interception and modification of requests and responses while interacting with web apps.**
## Repeater
**Allows for capturing, modifying and resending the same request multiple times.**
Helps to craft payloads through Trial and Error, like for SQL injections or testing other vulnerabilities.
## Intruder
**Allows for spraying endpoints with requests.** Used for brute-force attacks or fuzzing endpoints.
## Decoder
**Decodes data found in the requests.**
## Comparer
**Helps compare two pieces of data at the byte level.**
## Sequencer
Usually employed to **assess the randomness of tokens, such as session cookie values or other randomly generated data.**
## Extensions
The framework nature of Burp Suite allows one to **develop extensions in Java to add new features and enhance existing ones**.
Some extensions require the professional edition to be used with Burp Suite.
