SCADA Systems are essentially **the command centres of industrial operations** such as factories and assembly lines.
# Components
Multiple parts make most SCADA systems work:
## Sensors and Actuators
Sensors gather real-world data and conditions to dictate how the system should operate.
Actuators, on the other hand, are the system's "hands" in the real world: they do physical actions, like controlling robotic arms.
## Programmable Logic Controllers
These are the chips actually executing automation logic. They read sensor data, compute it to make decision, then forward those decisions to the actuators.
These are **custom built to sustain extreme conditions**, and execute control logic in real-time.
## Monitoring Systems
Interfaces like cameras, dashboards, alarm panels.
## Historians
Databases that store historical system data for review of incidents and the well-being of the system.
