PowerShell is a **tool from Microsoft designed to automate tasks and manage configurations**.
It combines a command-line interface and a scripting language built on the [[.NET]] framework.
# Object-Oriented CLI
Unlike most other command-line interface, **PowerShell is object-oriented** to match the .NET framework and Windows' capabilities.
Instead of being entirelly text-based like most other CLIs on the market, PowerShell cmdlets (command-lets) return objects that retain their properties and methods.
