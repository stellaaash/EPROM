Telnet is a client-server application protocol that provides access to virtual terminals or remote systems on local networks or the Internet.
It is a protocol for **bidirectional 8-bit communications**.
Its main historical goal was to connect terminal devices and terminal-oriented processes.
# Security
Telnet transmits all communications, including usernames and passwords, in plaintext.
This major vulnerability disqualifies telnet for any communication that might contain sensitive information.
# Uses
Telnet is often used in legacy equipment that doesn't support more modern communication protocols.
It is also sometimes used by [[Amateur Radio]] operators for providing public information.
Most useful of all, though, is its uses when **debugging network services such as [[SMTP]], [[IRC]] or [[HTTP]] servers**.
You can use it to issue commands to the server and examine the responses, examining them or just to see if a [[Servce]] is up.
