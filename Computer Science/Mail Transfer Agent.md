An MTA is **software that transfers electronic mail messages from one computer to another**.
It does this using the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]].
Sometimes called **mail server, mail exchanger or MX host**.
# How it works

## Transfer vs Access
A system that is used to relay or filter messages only will most likely only keep emails for a little while.
Sometimes though, systems may keep full mailboxes for emails, storing them for later access by end users via an email client.
Common protocols for this are:
- [[Post Office Protocol]] (POP3)
- [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP)
- Other proprietary systems
___
You usually submit new email from a mail client via [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]].
Nowadays, this is generally restricted to servers the user has an account with, like their [[Internet Service Provider]].
That way, the providers have means of holding their users accountable for the generation of spam and other form of abuse of emails.
