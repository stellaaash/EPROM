SSL or Secure Sockets Layer, is **a security protocol for encrypting data transmitted over the internet**.
It ensures privacy, authentication and data integrity.
You can use to help protect sensitive information, like credit card numbers and login credentials, from being intercepted and read by unwanted parties.
**SSL is now deprecated, and the newer [[Transport Layer Security]] protocol builds upon it.**
It pioneered the use of [[Certificates]], and TLS still uses those to this day. They are often called SSL Certificates, even when used alongside TLS.
