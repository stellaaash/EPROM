Data structures are ways to store data in a specific organization and format, allowing for efficient access to that data.
Most data structures are built on smaller, [[Primitive Type]]s.
# Implementation
While a given data structure keeps the same concept across languages, their implementation can very wildly, or not be present at all.
For example, [[Computer Science/Set]]s are present in python, C++ and many other languages, and might be implemented using a [[Hash Table]] ([[Hash Set]]) or some other way.
In other languages, like C, sets are not present at all.
# Examples
- [[Array]]
- [[Linked List]]
- [[Record]]
- [[Hash Table]]
- [[Graph]]
## Sets
- [[Computer Science/Set]]
- [[Hash Set]]
## Trees
- [[Tree]]
- [[Binary Tree]]
- [[AVL Tree]]
- [[B-Tree]]
