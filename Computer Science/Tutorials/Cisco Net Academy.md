Basics of networking
# Progress

# Notes
## 2.1 - Clients and Servers
Clients and servers are always determined by the software running on them.
Depending on the app, a machine could both be a client for a given app and a server for another.
Peer-to-peer is a network where both devices are able to be client or server as necessary.
## 2.2 - Network Components
End devices (or hosts) are the users' devices, like computers, printers and laptops.
Intermediary devices connect these devices together.
Network media is the way with which we communicate, wirelessly or through cables.
## 2.3 - ISP Connectivity Options
ISP stands for Internet Service Provider.
You connect your home network to your ISP directly using a **[[Modem]]**. Only using one is unsafe though, as your network would be left unprotected.
As such, most ISPs send you a **[[Router]]** that integrates the modem, in order for wireless and wired devices to be able to connect to the internet via the ISP's network.
### 2.3.3 - Cable vs DSL Connections
**Cable** provides internet access through the same **coaxial cable that delivers cable television**.
This way, you have high bandwidth, always on access to the internet.
A special modem is tasked with separating the internet data signal from other signals on the cable, and provides **Ethernet** connection to a host or LAN.
**DLS or Digital Subscriber Line** also provides high bandwidth, always on internet access.
It requires a special high-speed modem that gets the DSL signal from the telephone signal and also provides Ethernet to the LAN or a host.
DLS runs over a **telephone line**, with the line split into three channels: voice telephone calls, a fast download channel and a channel to upload information.
Usually, the upload speed is a bit slower than the download speed.
The quality and speed of DSL connections depends mainly on the quality of the phone line itself, and distance from the central office of your phone company.
**Nowadays though and in metropolitan areas, most homes are connected through fiber-optic cables that provide internet, phone and TV all at the same time.**
## 4.1 - Home Network Basics
When looking at labels on a router, for example, **Ethernet** refers to ports used to connect to local devices, and **Internet** refers to the port.s used to connect to another network entirely.
## 4.3 - Wireless standards
IEEE 802.11 specifies modern standards used in Wi-Fi connectivity on 2.4 and 5 Ghz, among many others.
### SSID
The SSID (or Service Set IDentifier) of a wireless network or WLAN is **an ID that must be shared by all devices that want to partake in the WLAN**.
By default, **most access points broadcast their SSID to all devices within range, so that they can connect**.
Effectively, **the SSID identifies the WLAN among others**. This is useful when multiple access points are in range.
It consists of a case-sensitive, alphanumeric string that contains up to 32 characters.
It is sent in the header of all frames transmitted over the WLAN.
### Network Mode
The **network mode** of an access point determines which 802.11 protocol version to use at minimum.
If all devices use the same protocol standard, maximum speeds can be obtained **for that standard**.
An access point can also be configured to accept only one 802.11 standard, and devices must conform to connect.
A **mixed mode wireless network** is a network where devices can connect from several different standards at a time, not restricting to a specific one.
