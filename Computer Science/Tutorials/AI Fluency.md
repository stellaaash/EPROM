A course about learning to interact with [[Large Language Model]]s (referenced as "AI" in this course) in meaningful ways, proning efficient and productive collaboration.
# 01 - Introduction
AI fluency means **the ability to collaborate with AI in ways that are effective, efficient, ethical and safe**.
There are four AI Fluency core competencies called **the 4Ds**.
- Delegation
- Description
- Discernment
- Diligence

# 02 - The AI Fluency Framework
## Why do we need AI Fluency?
As the technology keeps evolving, it's important to know how to interact with it in efficient, secure and ethical ways.
There are **three main ways of interacting with AI**:
- ### Automation, where the AI does work for you
  For example, drafting documents, or writing a web app from scratch.
  **Does your work for you.** Useful when you have a very clear outcome in mind.
- ### Augmentation, where the AI and yourself collaborate towards a given goal
  For example, when you have a problem with a task, discussing it with the AI to find solutions, and through a back-and-forth, have a better vision of what's the next step for you.
  **Helps you do better work.** Useful when the outcome isn't so clear, and you need help exploring the subject.
- ### Agency, where AI works independently on your behalf.
  For example, setting up an AI assistant to automatically categorize emails, or giving interactive answers in an application.
  You're preparing the AI by fine-tuning its knowledge and behavior, so it's better at its given task.
  It's a bit like **a director setting a vision** for what someone has to do.
**All approaches are useful in their own context**, depending on your situation.
You might use all three interchangeably in a single project.
