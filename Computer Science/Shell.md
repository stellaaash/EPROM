An [[Operating System]]'s shell is a program that gives broad and **direct access** to a system it runs on.
Basically a direct interface between the user and the system's [[Kernel]]. You type in commands to ask the system to do stuff for you.
The name "shell" represents a thin layer around the operating system itself.
# Examples of shells

- [[bash]]
- [[csh]]
