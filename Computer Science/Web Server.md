A web server is software (and the underlying hardware) that **accepts [[HyperText Transfer Protocol]] requests**, or it's secure variant [[HTTPS]], and fulfills them.
A user agent, like a web browser or crawler, starts communications by **making a request** for a specific resource hosted on the server.
That can include **web pages or any other resource** you can load using HTTP.
If configured correctly, a web server may also **accept ressources and store them** for later use.
