The Bourne Again SHell `bash`, the GNU [[Shell]] that's usable on basically all unix systems.
An interactive command interpreter AND a programming language too.
Initially created for the [[GNU Project]], and still maintained by the [[Free Software Foundation]] to this day.
It was designed to be a 100% free alternative to the Bourne Shell ([[sh]]).
# Shell scripts
Bash is capable of interpreting `.sh` files containing raw commands usually executed within Bash itself, allowing for complex scripts executing repetitive tasks or automation.
# Bash operators
```bash
&  # Allows you to run commands in the background of a terminal session
&&  # Allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line
>  # Sends the output of a command to a file, creating it if needed and erasing all contents found inside
>>  # Sends the output of a command to a file, creating it if needed and adding to the contents found inside
```
