Selection sorting an array means **iterating over it and swapping the lowest value to the start of the array** until all values are in place.
You do this by having one loop iterating over the array, then at each number you find the next lowest number forward (until the end of the array) and swap the two.

Has **O(n^2)** efficiency. Is twice as fast as [[Bubble Sort]].
