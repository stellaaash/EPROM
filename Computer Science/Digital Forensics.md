Digital Forensics is **the application of methods and procedures to investigate and solve crimes by using digital devices**.
# Methodology
Each digital forensics team might have a different methodology, but in the US, the National Institute of Standards and Technology defines a general process for each case.
`Collection -> Examination -> Analysis -> Reporting`
## Collection
The first phase, this consists in... well, **collecting all the data that is relevant to the investigation**.
This also involves finding all devices that might have important data.
"Device" in this case **can range from phones and computers to physical media as well**, like cameras, storage devices, etc...
## Examination
The collected data might be huge. As such, this data **needs to be filtered** in order to be analyzed next.
You might filter it based on the date of the incident, keeping only the last two weeks, for example.
Or, you might filter data based on who it belongs to, if you're looking into an individual in particular.
## Analysis
The most important phase, this consists of **analyzing the data by correlating it with multiple other pieces of evidence to draw conclusions**.
It all depends on the case scenario and available data, but always **aims to extract the chronology of the case** by finding relevant information inside of the devices.
## Reporting
The last phase where **a report is prepared** about the events, the clues and the conclusions drawn.
It also must report the **methodology used** and might add **recommendations**.
The report is then **presented to law enforcement and executive management (depending on the case)**.
# Evidence Acquisition
As it is so important, **evidence acquisition must be carried out lawfully and correctly**.
All evidence has to be protected from any tampering as well to ensure that an accurate depiction of the facts will be created.
## Authorization
For evidence to be valid in court, it must have been gathered under a proper authorization agreement signed by all parties involved.
## Chain of Custody
A chain of custody is a **formal document containing all the details of the evidence, including who was holding it and for how long during the investigation**.
This helps prevent tampering with the evidence, as you can figure out when changes occurred, and, critically, under the responsibility of whom.
A chain of custody document might contain:
- **Description** of the evidence (name, type).
- Name of individuals who **collected** the evidence.
- **Date and time** of evidence **collection**.
- Storage **location** of each piece of evidence.
- **Access times** and the **individual** record who accessed the evidence.
## Write Blockers
When getting data from a suspect's devices, using write blockers can help **prevent the evidence from being altered before it is collected**.
For example, if you're booting up a suspect's computer with the hard drive still attached, some timestamps might change, or files altered completely.
A physical write blocker on the drive prevents such unwanted changes from happening.
