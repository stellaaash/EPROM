A binary-to-text encoding system that transforms binary data into a sequence of printable characters in base64 (from base 10 all the way through the alphabet in lower and uppercase, as well as 3 special characters to reach 64).
# Uses
Often used to transmit information of the internet in a form that's more compact than raw binary (and easier to display, too).
