A simple directive consists of the name and parameters separated by spaces and ends with a semicolon (`;`). A block directive has the same structure as a simple directive, but instead of the semicolon it ends with a set of additional instructions surrounded by braces (`{` and `}`). If a block directive can have other directives inside braces, it is called a context (examples: [events](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#events), [http](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#http), [server](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server), and [location](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location)).\n> Directives placed in the configuration file outside of any contexts are considered to be in the [main](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html) context. The `events` and `http` directives reside in the `main` context, `server` in `http`, and `location` in `server`.\n> The rest of a line after the `#` sign is considered a comment.[^1]\n\nOur config file for webserv should be directly based on nginx's config file format.
