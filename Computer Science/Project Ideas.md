# Heat Abnormal - MeteoSwiss parser
Something built on the MeteoSwiss API allowing automated and free retrieval of their data.
I could build something like a pollen watcher for spring, but the dream idea would be this:
**A real-time precipitation radar.** [Like this.](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/applications/precipitation.html)

# Apricot - Music player
A full desktop application allowing for audio playback on a specific OS (probably Linux).
Start with a simple audio format like .wav, and work your way up from there.
# Actress - Video Player
A later project that would build upon Apricot by implementing a video player.
# ILS (Imaginary Love Story) - Fully fledged ray tracer
Basically miniRT and more, written in another language instead of C. Rust or Zig?
Use the `vulkano` crate if the former. Might use the mlx with C interop if the latter.

# LagTrain
Android widget that shows me only my relevant trains, using the CFF api.
Could be built using Zig to WebAssembly, since it runs on android widgets. Other options include React native.
