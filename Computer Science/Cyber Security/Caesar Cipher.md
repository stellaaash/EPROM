The Caesar Cipher is an old algorithm from the first century after JC.
The idea is simple: **shift each letter by a certain number to encrypt the message**.
# Strength
As there are only 26 letters in the alphabet, this cipher only contains 25 possible keys for a given cipher-text.
This makes it trivial to brute-force the cipher once you know it is a caesar.
