SIEM systems are popular tools used in every [[Security Operations Center]].
It **collects logs from network devices to be able to detect suspicious activity using policies.**
It mainly exists to **enhance the analysis of logs and events**; indeed, the sheer amount of information generated by a system would be impossible to humanly review in short-enough timings.
It centralizes logs, creates statistics and provides real-time alerting based on pre-made rules.
It correlates logs based on activities to find suspicious patterns.
# Log Gathering
As SIEMS are essentially gatherers of logs, they need ways for these logs to be collected from the machines to watch.
There are multiple ways for SIEMS to gather logs. Here are a few examples.
## Agent / Forwarder
These are small utilities running on target machines that report key information or logs back to the main SIEM server.
## Syslog
This is a widely used *protocol* used to collect data from [[Web Server]]s, [[Database]]s, etc...
## Manual Upload
Of course, most SIEMs also allow users to directly ingest relevant data for analysis.
## Port-Forwarding
Some SIEM solutions can also be configured **to listen on a certain port**, to which the endpoints to watch forward the data.
