CVEs are **unique numbers given to digital vulnerabilities**.
They were developed by the [[MITRE Corporation]].
Whenever a new vulnerability is identified, **it is given a CVE number and published online in CVE databases**.
This helps make vulnerability details public for easier patching by the concerned entities.
# Structure
Each CVE number starts with a `CVE` prefix, and is then followed by **the year and four or more arbitrary digits representing the ID of the vulnerability**.
`CVE-2024-9374`, for example, has been discovered in 2024, according to its CVE number.
# CVSS
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System scores CVEs according to their threat levels.
It uses a score **from 0 to 10**, with 10 being the most critical.
