Port forwarding consists in **forwarding an open port to (usually) the router of a private network, to allow distant connection to it**.
For example, if you have a web server running on a network, you'd forward port 80 of that server to the router, so that external devices can connect to the web server by using the router's **public [[IP Address]]**.
