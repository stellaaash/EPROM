PSK or Pre-Shared Key is a protocol by which two devices communicate by encrypted messages.
These messages are encrypted using an encryption key that is the same for both server and client, thus the name.
# Security
It's good enough for non-critical systems such as monitoring software and other uses, but if you know your system might be the direct target for attacks, you might consider stronger alternatives such as [[TLS]] certificates.
