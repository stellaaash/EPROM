Search Engines allow for easy retrieval and scraping of information on the world wide web.
# Search Engine Operators
Here are some of the main search engine operators that you can add to your queries supported by Google:
- `"double quote"`: Double quotes indicate that you are looking for the exact pattern between the quotes.
- `site: domain.com` This operator lets you specify the domain name you want to limit your research to.
- `-query`: The minus sign omits a particular word or phrase from search results.
- `filetype: type`: Allows to specify which file types you want in your results. Helps to find files instead of web pages.
