A number of elements in a specific order.
Depending on the programming language, all elements must be of the same type.
# Accessing the data
Accessing elements in an array is usually done by providing an index number `n`, and the array will look at the `n`-th element stored inside.
Most arrays start at element `0`, with the notable exception of Lua and some other languages starting at `1` instead.
