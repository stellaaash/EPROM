A core dump, also called a memory dump, crash dump, storage dump, system dump, or ABEND dump, is a recorded state of the working memory of a [[Program]] at a specific time.
Often, it's the [[Operating System]] that dumps the core of a program when it stops, either unexpectedly or expectedly (at a user's command like when using ^\\ on [[Linux]]).
In practice, there's often other parts of the state of a program that are dumped, like the [[Processor]] registers (like the program counter and [[Stack]] pointer), memory management information and other CPU and OS flags and information.
