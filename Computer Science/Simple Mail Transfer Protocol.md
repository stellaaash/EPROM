The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is a standard internet communication protocol **for electronic mail transmission**.
Mail servers and [[Mail Transfer Agent]]s use SMTP to send and receive mail messages.
Users use clients that typically use SMTP **only for sending messages** to a mail server, which then relays them appropriately.
For retrieving messages, on the other hand, [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] is often used, or its older counterpart the [[Post Office Protocol]].
