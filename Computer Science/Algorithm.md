A very broad term referring to a set of instructions leading to a result. Usually, algorithms are described in plain language to make them reproductible in any programming language or even other stuff.
There are loooots of types of algorithms, and you can invent one for pretty much anything. What interests us here, though, are algorithms used in computer science and programming specifically.

# Common algorithms
- [[Sorting Algorithms]]
- [[Binary Search]]
- [[Binary Tree 1]] traversal
- [[Breadth-First Search]]
- [[Depth-First Search]]
