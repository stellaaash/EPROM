RSA or the Rivest-Shamir-Adlman algorithm is a **[[Public-key Cryptography]] encryption algorithm that enables secure data transmission over insecure channels**.
The general idea is to exploit the loophole that *while multiplying two numbers is easy, figuring out which numbers were used in a multiplication with a final result isn't*.
