VLANs or Virtual [[Local Area Network]]s allow specific **devices within a network to be virtually split up**.
This separation occurs at the [[OSI Model]]'s layer 2, data link.
It being at layer 2 means that it's the [[Switch]]'s job to enforce VLANs: it only routes data from a VLAN to other members of that same VLAN.
This network separation provides security because it prevents devices in different VLANs from talking to each other.
