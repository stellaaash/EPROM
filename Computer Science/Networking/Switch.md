A networking device that **connects multiple devices to the same network**.
Switches are more efficient than the lesser hubs or repeaters.
Switches can operate at both layer 2 or 3 of the [[OSI Model]]. This is exclusive though, it can only operate on one layer at a time.
# How do they work
- A switch's main function is handling of incoming network packets and redirecting them to the appropriate destination device according to the [[IP Address]] found in the packet header.
- They keep track of what device is connected to each port, so they can send each packet to its destination directly instead of broadcasting it to everyone that's connected (what a hub would do).
# Physical Structure
Switches can have a number of ports, ranging but not limited to 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 64 for devices to plug into.
