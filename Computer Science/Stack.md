A stack is basically like an [[Array]], with a major restriction: **only the top element (the one that was added last) is accessible**.
Stacks are part of the [[Abstract Data Type]]s.
This makes the stack (and it's sibling the [[Queue]]) an elegant solution for holding temporary data.
# Terminology
When adding data on the stack, you *push* it.
When taking an item off of the stack, you *pop* it.
Stacks are *Last-In-First-Out or LIFO*.
