WebAssembly or Wasm for short, is a **binary instruction format for a stack-based [[Virtual Machine]]**.
It enables deployment on the web for client and server applications.
It describes a memory-safe, sandboxed execution environment that is small enough to be implemented even in JavaScript virtual machines.
Aiming for speed, it tries to execute as quick as native applications on a given hardware.
