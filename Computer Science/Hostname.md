In networking, hostname means **a label that is given to a device connected to a network**.
It is **used to identify the device** among others, on the Internet but also in other means of communication.
Each hostname usually has at least one numeric network address associated with it.
Those very often take the form of [[IP Address]]es.
# On the Internet
On the Internet, a hostname is a [[Domain Name]] assigned to a host computer.
Usually, this is a combination of the host's local name along with its parent domain's name.
For example, `en.wikipedia.org` consists of the local name `en` along with the parent domain `wikipedia.org`.
It is possible for a single host to have **multiple hostnames**, but in general the [[Operating System]] prefers to have only one that it uses to refer to itself.
**Any domain name can also be a hostname** if it has an associated [[IP Address]], via the [[Domain Name System]], for example.
