A binary search tree is **a [[Binary Tree 1]] (that can have at most two children) that sorts its descendants.**
It does this by having each node put the child lower than itself as its left descendant, and the child higher than itself as its right one.
It can traversed using in-order, pre-order or post-order traversal algorithms.
