# Folders
Pages are structured in folders, which **determine the general theme of the pages within**.
For example, a folder for Math, one for Music, one for Computer Science.
In subfolders, structure with sub-themes. For example, in Computer Science, a folder for Networking, a folder for Cybersecurity.
# Tags
Tags are to refer to **the type of the page**.
This means that tags should contain relevant keywords regarding the type of what the page is describing.
For example, #compiler for Clang and GCC, or #hardware for Routers and Switches.
