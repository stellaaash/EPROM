\<Still reading it so this might change>
I think it's a pretty well rounded overview of the psychology behind computer programming (the title is pretty fitting in my opinion), and especially of the mind of programmers and how they work. It's pretty interesting from a managerial standpoint too, though I completely lack the experience to make myself a good opinion on whether the ideas it gives on managing programmers still hold up in today's era.
Cause yes, it's kinda dated. In a lot of ways, but most are more apparent than just "oh it speaks about [[FORTRAN]] or [[PI/I]]" or those kinds of things. More in a deep, internal way; the ideas of our society just aren't the same in a lot of ways.
Doesn't mean the book isn't still full of good advice though, even after several decades.
