# Heat Abnormal - MeteoSwiss parser
Something built on the MeteoSwiss API allowing automated and free retrieval of their data.
I could build something like a pollen watcher for spring, but the dream idea would be this:
**A real-time precipitation radar.** [Like this.](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/applications/precipitation.html)

# Apricot - Music player
A full desktop application allowing for audio playback on a specific OS (probably Linux).
Start with a simple audio format like .wav, and work your way up from there.
# Actress - Video Player
A later project that would build upon Apricot by implementing a video player.
# Wasure - Fully fledged ray tracer in Rust
Basically miniRT and more, written in Rust instead of C.
Use the `vulkano` crate.
