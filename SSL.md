SSL or Secure Sockets Layer, is a security protocol for encrypting data transmitted over the internet.
It ensures privacy, authentification and data integrity.
You can use to help protect sensitive information, like credit card numbers and login credentials, from being intercepted and read by unwanted parties.
**SSL is now deprecated, and the newer [[TLS]] protocol builds upon it.**
